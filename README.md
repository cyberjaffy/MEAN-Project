MEAN Stack Deployment to Ubuntu in AWS.
Overview
In this project, we implement a web solution based on the MEAN stack deployed to an Ubuntu server hosted on AWS cloud infrastructure.

The MEAN stack consists of the following technologies:

MongoDB: A document-based, No-SQL database used to store application data as JSON-like documents.

Express.js: A server-side web application framework used to build the backend RESTful API.

AngularJS: A front-end framework to handle client-side requests and dynamic UI rendering.

Node.js: A JavaScript runtime environment to build scalable server applications serving requests and responses.

The application developed is a simple Book Register web form that allows users to Create, Read, and Delete book records stored in MongoDB.

Prerequisites
Before starting, make sure you have:

An AWS account with an EC2 virtual server running Ubuntu (preferably a t2.micro instance).

Git Bash installed on your local machine.

An SSH key pair to access your EC2 instance via Git Bash terminal.
